# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This is where I will be storing my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming challenge is released, and participants work to solve them. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have some fun during the holiday season.

You can learn more about Advent of Code and participate in the challenges at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

This year, I am solving the challenges using Python.
